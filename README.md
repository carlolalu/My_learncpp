# my_learncpp
'learncpp.com' + random exercises

Here I add various exercises and eventually small projects to learn cpp, following mainly the website learncpp.com. Others are taken from the project euler (for which a high level language like python or julia would be better) or eventually edabit or similar.

PS: all these exercises are compiled with this command:
```
# compiler as learncpp adivises
# with the right standards in debug conf
 alias gpp-pedantic='g++ -ggdb -pedantic-errors -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Werror -Wsign-conversion -std=c++20'
```

- update: the website `learncpp.com` is sometimes updated, and as can be verified in the middle of my tutorial it got updated. Thus the two folders. Because of this reason it becomes VERY important to havea  reference book, a pdf or similar, to which I can get acquainted to better retrieve information from it, rather than having this website, which is excellent to learn but surely not as a reference.
