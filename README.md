# my_learncpp
'learncpp' + random exercises

Here I add various exercises and eventually small projects to learn cpp, following mainly the website learncpp.com. Others are taken from the project euler (for which a high level language like python or julia would be better) or eventually edabit or similar.

PS: all these exercises are compiled with this command:
```
# compiler as learncpp adivises
# with the right standards in debug conf
 alias gpp-pedantic='g++ -ggdb -pedantic-errors -Wall -Weffc++ -Wextra -Werrors -Wsign-conversion -std=c++20'

```
