topic 1: learncpp.com (one day I will be able to write here 'FINISHED!')
23.3

topic 2: learn smt about computer networks from the book 'a top down approach'.
Bookmark : ch2 - 2.1.3 (remember homeworks when you finish 2.1 and wireshark lab)

left behind: most of problems of ch1 (beautiful mathematical things)

From now on I advise to do a section and then some problems every time. Another option is to use the book of Kurose ONLINE. It has a lot of good exercises and powerpoint presentations!!! I have also to select just a number of exercises, cannot do all of them

topic 2b: practice of topic2 following the website of the book
